       In the Linux operating system, the kernel is the core component that manages system resources and provides a bridge between the hardware and software. Kernel modules and device drivers are essential elements that extend the functionality of the kernel, allowing it to support new hardware and provide additional features. Here\'s an overview of Linux kernel modules and device drivers:
